African-Americans! So… you know, it’s really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",

During the course of the series, Jim marries Pam Beasley and subsequently becomes quite motivated to succeed as a paper salesman. There are many instances in The Office where Jim spends very little time attempting to increase his paper sales instead spending considerable time trying to win the affections of Pam. Jim also spends an inordinate amount of time playing tricks on Dwight or entertaining his co-workers which he primarily does to entertain Pam.",
