And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.</Text>

            <Text>Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.</Text>

I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.</Text>

Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?</Text>

That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!</Text>

Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I'd get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.</Text>
