            <Text>Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.</Text>

            <Text>I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...</Text>

            <Text>I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like "Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas" Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.</Text>

            <Text>What if Dunder Mifflin were to take on 15-20 foster kids? You'd get huge checks from the government and honestly they would be ecstatic to live in the warehouse. It would be like Hogwart's.</Text>
