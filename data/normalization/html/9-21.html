random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"

random_text[number++] = "That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you."

random_text[number++] = "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."
random_text[number++] = "I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
random_text[number++] = "Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ."
random_text[number++] = "You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."

random_text[number++] = "Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
random_text[number++] = "It's an epidemic."
random_text[number++] = "Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?"
random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
random_text[number++] = "I think green is kind of whoreish."

random_text[number++] = "Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."
random_text[number++] = "The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion."
random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."

<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> I’m taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> It’s great.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> It’s great.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> But that doesn’t matter. This does. It’s the only thing that matters. We’ve had some really nice days together.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Nice morning, too.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Beesly! Oh, my god.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent’s putting me up for a furniture commercial.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Ah, definitely blue.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what’s up? Back in the small pond?   <br /><b>Jim:</b> For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin—  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can’t give 100% to two things at once you know.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Tell me about it, you know? I’ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don’t know if I’m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> Huh. Well, you know, you can’t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what’s most important. That’s my new thing.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Oscar:</b> [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?  <br /><b>Angela:</b> No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Wait, all of them?  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Two sacks’ worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> That’s—that’s awful, Angela. I’m so sorry.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> It’s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She’s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> I’ve never met anyone like that.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> And they’re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.   <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Angela, you still have your son.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> I guess.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Smasher!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Smasher? No, where’d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city’s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don’t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Fireball!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Ah! [throws punch] That’s how it’s done.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> That’s pretty good. I feel safe.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said “is Indian” and was like, “Is Indian what?” Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Erin:</b> Lately, I’ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy’s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Erin:</b> Yes, there’s Andy! Andy is in. I’m a good receptionist, I know he’s in.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> David Walrus, in his native habitat.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> This isn’t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, “The kind that’s good for head shots.” And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it’s gonna boost office morale. Now, he’s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> Andy—  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I’m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Uh-huh, but—  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I’ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> So you think you’ve been too focused on your job?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.   <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> So you—you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don’t—it just… I owe it to myself and my future fans.   <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Uh, well, I guess I can’t stand in the way of a man’s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you, David.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> There’s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Nope. I have made up my mind. I’m really sorry.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Well, good luck.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you. Not gonna need it.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Okay.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> Well that kind of worked out.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Creed:</b> I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> Oh, Clark. I’m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.  <br /><b>Clark:</b> Right. Yeah. But, you know, I’ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I’ve earned this. I mean, you know?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I’m here.  <br /><b>Clark:</b> Right. Well, I’m here to sell paper.   <br /><b>Pam:</b> Wow.  <br /><b>Clark:</b> All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And—and Wallace is here today. And I don’t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?   <br /><b>Pam:</b> it’s okay. You can sit in the annex.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> What?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I’ll come visit you.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay. The annex it is. I’ll be sitting at your desk if that’s okay with you.  <br /><b>Clark:</b> That’s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete’s beautiful, dead eyes.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I’m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> I can’t say we didn’t see it coming. But it’s a sad day when anybody is fired. We’re so sorry, Andy.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> I wasn’t fired. What are you talking about? I’m fired up, yes. Guys, I’m—I’m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.   <br /><b>Pam:</b> Oh, Andy.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, so, I’ll see you on the red carpet. See, that’s how it works.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Phyllis:</b> Andy sings beautifully. And he’s really good at dancing. He’s a good speaker. But there’s just something there you don’t want to look at.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.  <br /><b>Pete:</b> Yeah, a little bit.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, wow. But, um—Oh, I get that.   <br /><b>Pete:</b> Oh, no, no, no. No it’s cool.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I get it.  <br /><b>Pete:</b> It’s cool, man. I’m sure you and I will have our own thing.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don’t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Darryl:</b> I just think you’re going into this a little fast.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I’m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Show business is cold. Let’s say you get a job, which you probably won’t. They’re not gonna cut you any slack. You’re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> All right. I get it.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> The male is a funny species. We don’t just tell each other how we feel, that’s chick stuff. So instead of saying, “Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don’t want you to leave.” You say something like, “Hey, Andy, you’re making the worst mistake of your life. You’re not talented.” Well… right back at you, Darryl.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> [hugs Darryl] I’m gonna miss you too. Mmm!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Stanley:</b> Andy’s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Kevin:</b> Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don’t know. You know who’s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can’t fly right. I’d pay to see him. But I don’t have to cause the park is free!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Sensei:</b> I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> It’s not a large room, I think they heard me.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> That’s really ok. I’m mostly focused on the belt here.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Just slip it off my—Slip it off my hips.   <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can’t—I can’t do this if you’re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we’re gonna have to cut this off.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Angela:</b> Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> There it is. [everyone applauds]  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Congratulations.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> We did it, we did it. I love you.  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Okay.   <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You’re gonna watch me right?  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]   <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Sensei, you’re not watching.   <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Yeah, I’m watching. Just do it.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Watching?  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> I’m watching.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Watch this part, okay?  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.   <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> He said that? He’s an odd guy, isn’t he?  <br /><b>Sensei:</b> Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he’s one of the most tenacious and determined men I’ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]  <br /><b>Esther:</b> Oh! I’m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn’t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Clark:</b> Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You did not just say that! You don’t know Pam. She is really cool.  <br /><b>Clark:</b> All I’m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager’s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It’s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I’d be happy to see Jim as manager.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> Again.   <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Again! And I’m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Not at all. It should be Dwight.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> You sure?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You’re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Yeah.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don’t want to meet that person.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Nellie:</b> Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> It’s now or never.   <br /><b>Nellie:</b> Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, sure. What’s your question?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Our question is—it seems dumb.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well, it’s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?  <br /><b>Nellie:</b> Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and “full-ass” it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Nah. I like my plan better.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You’re too character-y to be a lead and you’re not fat enough to be a great character actor.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> What?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Oscar:</b> No, I don’t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can’t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yes. Yeah.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Oh, boy. Um—  <br /><b>Jim:</b> If you could help me out, that would be—  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I could give you some beginner stickies?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Anything would help.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Here you go.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, also, while you’re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Mm-hmm.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> Wow, that’s—  <br /><b>Pam:</b> It’s all yours.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You come so prepared. Aspirin.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It’s really great.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager’s job?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.   <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yeah, right. I’m afraid that ship has sailed.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Just saying.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Hello.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well, hello.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Big day for you.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Big day for you.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Thank you.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Love the belt.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Oh, yes.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> You know, I don’t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog’s outta here, so letting it all hang out!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> This is exciting! You’re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Oh, I doubt you’ll make it. Very few do who’ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you’ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don’t quit your day job.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.   <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You’re bad.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> I’m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That’s something you can’t take back.   <br /><b>Erin:</b> So true. Is there a question, or are—what?   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?   <br /><b>Erin:</b> Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you. [steps into conference room]  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you.

<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Say it again.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Will you be the new manager?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Where?  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Where?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> What branch?  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let’s go. It’s good news.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I’m sorry. I’ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.   <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> What?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> But this isn’t interim manager. No. It’s Dwight K. Schrute… [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> Why do you already have this?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> I know.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I will never, ever let you down.  <br /><b>David Wallace:</b> I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight’s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You’re gonna do great.   </div>

I’m gonna wait.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> All right. I did not come back here just to see you.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I’m sure you did not. What was your question?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I don’t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I’m waiting.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Exactly.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I’m gonna stay on in sales.  <br /><b>Nellie:</b> Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don’t want to see you in a porn next year.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Okay.   <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Ooh, there’s a great play about a salesman.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Death of a salesman.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> I don’t think so.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman’ by Arthur Miller, it’s a great play about crushed dreams.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [sits at Dwight’s desk] Got any hot leads?   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pete:</b> See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> I had no idea.

Oh, hey, look, and now it’s like a double date.   <br /><b>Pete:</b> Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That’d be fun.   <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Well, how about Thursday?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Oh, well, Thursday’s tough, because of—  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Weeknights are actually tough just because—  <br /><b>Pam:</b> They are.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> That’s true, yeah.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Just forget it.

<div class="quote">  <b>David Wallace:</b> Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute—  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> David.

<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It’s cause I had a fallback. That’s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it’s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.  </div>

I can’t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I’ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.   <br /><b>Toby:</b> Andy, you know I can’t do that.

[clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I’m doing the right thing.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Angela:</b> Andy.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> What are you doing?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don’t squash my knickety-knacks on top.   <br /><b>Angela:</b> Yeah, okay. That’s not what I mean. You don’t have to leave because you said you would. Don’t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It’s not worth it.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too—  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Ugh.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> But I just—it’s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn’t…  <br /><b>Angela:</b> No, that’s not—  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Rehash—  <br /><b>Angela:</b> No, none—No, stop. It’s just—  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Exactly.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.   <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thanks, Angela. You too.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Thanks.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.  <br /><b>Nellie:</b> Oh, good lord.  <br /><b>Stanley:</b> Can’t you just leave?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Tuna, I’m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ‘I Will Remember You’—everyone is slightly impressed]  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> [whispering] You okay?  <br /><b>Angela:</b> [crying] It’s just a really nice song.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> [everyone applauding] Awesome!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Phyllis:</b> Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He’s not terrible.   <br /><b>Stanley:</b> Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> No, he’s good.   <br /><b>Stanley:</b> He was good.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Oscar:</b> Good night, Kevin.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Night, Oscar.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.   <br /><b>Angela:</b> Well, I’ve changed my mind.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Wait a minute. You’re not thinking of living in a—  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Okay, I’m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.   <br /><b>Angela:</b> Oh, god.   <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Come stay with me.   <br /><b>Angela:</b> You don’t want me at your place.   <br /><b>Oscar:</b> I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won’t be long. It’s the least I could do.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Well…  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Separate bathrooms.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Thank you.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> You’re welcome. Let’s go get Phillip. Then we’ll get your stuff…  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Okay.   <br /><b>Oscar:</b> And get you the hell outta that place.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Are you allowed to have pets?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Oh, Angela.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Darryl:</b> You talk to Wade and Colin?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What’s up?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> We got an offer on the table.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> What kind of offer?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> A buyout.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> What?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> We’re in play, baby.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, my god!  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it’s not just a Philly play, so get this: they’re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Wow, that is… wow.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Yeah, we did it.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that’s gonna take?   <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, man. Yeah, I can’t do it.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Can’t do what?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> This, man. I can’t do this to Pam.   <br /><b>Darryl:</b> No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.   <br /><b>Jim:</b> I know. And I can’t do it.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Angela:</b> So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> No, it’s neat and tasteful, like most gay men’s homes. The stereotype holds up.  <br /><b>Angela:</b> I wouldn’t know. I never lived with a gay guy.   <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Angela, you just were—  <br /><b>Angela:</b> [starts sobbing] I love him.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can’t—  <br /><b>Angela:</b> No, not the senator. I love Dwight.  </div>
