Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it."}, {"speaker": "Erin", "text": "Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.
