This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." The Holy Grail.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?</QuoteText>
