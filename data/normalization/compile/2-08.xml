            <QuoteText>I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because "Oh, I regret that."  But, "Wait, I'm still gonna call you."  But, but, "We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>The other night, I gave him a polite congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his career. And that's it. If anything else has been implied, Dwight, or inferred, Michael, Creed, it's just not true, okay? It's not true. So... Is everyone straight on that?</QuoteText>

If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.</QuoteText>
