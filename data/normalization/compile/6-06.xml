I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say...

            <QuoteText>I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.</QuoteText>

So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.</QuoteText>
