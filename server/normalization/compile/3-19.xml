            <QuoteText>Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.</QuoteText>

Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, "Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?"  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note:</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome.  [Karen lays money down on the desk next to Ryan] And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome.  But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it's at the bottom of the que!  Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this.  I go online, I go click, click, click.  And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually [Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to.  It's so easy, Ryan.  Do you really not know how Netflix works? [Jim throws his money down]</QuoteText>
