            <QuoteText>Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced "sob-ray"]  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.</QuoteText>
