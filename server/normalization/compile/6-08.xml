            <QuoteText>Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together".  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I- God- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.</QuoteText>
