            <QuoteText>That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I've commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.</QuoteText>
