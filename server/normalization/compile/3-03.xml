            <QuoteText>Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it.  I'm told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn't play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a "so there" look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.</QuoteText>
