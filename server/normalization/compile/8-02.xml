            <QuoteText>Let me tell you how I buy something these days.  I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price.  Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me.  The era of personal service is back. You are back.  You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people.  Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen.  Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>When you're a kid, you picture a pilot kinda like this [imitates plane noises while steering wildly] But then you learn that's crashing the plane. The right way to do it is more like this. [calmly pulls imaginary steering back and forth] Or better yet, like this. [takes hands off imaginary wheel] Now that I'm manager, I think about that a lot. I let Dwight run the meetings, I let good people do good work and I stay out of the way.</QuoteText>

            <QuoteText>I thought the plane was flying pretty well on auto-pilot. And then Robert California ran into the cockpit with a gun and he was like "Fly this plane to Cuba, and on the way bomb Texas" Well I don't know how to get there. Or even how to fly, even. And I don't have any bombs.</QuoteText>
