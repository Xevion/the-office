And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.

Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.
