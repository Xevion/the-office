Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.</Text>

            <Text>Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.</Text>

            <Text>But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all.  It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.</Text>

            <Text>[on film] You have to understand.  Poets, artists, dancers - these kind of men preferred peace to war.  These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms.  Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight.  I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous.</Text>

You don't have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head.  I'm wearing a very pink hat.  I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure "DM does GB" means something kinda sexual.  But guess who's wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That's huge.</Text>

I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager.
