He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, "Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?"  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note:</Text>

I go online, I go click, click, click.  And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually [Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to.  It's so easy, Ryan.
