random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"

random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."

random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."

random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."

random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."

random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."

random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."
random_text[number++] = "Let's go. The men's room was disgusting."

<div class="quote">  				<b>Gabe:</b> [to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It&#8217;s this horrible plipping sound. You know, it&#8217;s like Chinese water torture. Just&#8230;[makes popping sound] like it&#8217;s coming from my own head. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly&#8217;s back]<br />  				<b>Holly:</b> Ohh.

<div class="quote">  				<b>Holly:</b> I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He&#8217;s a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.   				</div>

Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Seeing as it&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you&#8217;d expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. <br />  				<b>Ryan:</b> Speaking of, Gabe, I don&#8217;t see Erin at this meeting. <br />  				<b>Meredith:</b> Uh, I also don&#8217;t see Andy. <br />  				<b>Kevin:</b> Oooh. <br />  				<b>Jim:</b> OOH! Boom! Face! <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> I get it. Andy&#8217;s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. <br />  				<b>Pam:</b> Yeah. What? Us?<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> They don&#8217;t touch. They don&#8217;t kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. <br />  				<b>Jim:</b> Did it! <br />  				<b>Pam:</b> Yeah! <br />  				<b>Jim:</b> Love it. Keep it goin. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Okay. So, PDAs. That&#8217;s gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh&#8230;<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b> Booby honking. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Yeah, booby honking. Sure. <br />  				<b>Kevin:</b> Butt honking. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking. <br />  				<b>Creed:</b> The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap&#8230;<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Sure. Basically, there&#8217;s no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. <br />  				<b>Oscar:</b> Are you guys listening to this? <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> What, are you talking about me and Holly? <br />  				<b>Pam:</b> Yeah! <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Maybe you find your own chair.   				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Holly:</b> So we kiss occasionally. <br />  				<b>Oscar:</b> Not occasionally. All the time. <br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b> Yeah, and it&#8217;s not just the kissing. It&#8217;s the flirtatious whispering. <br />  				<b>Stanley:</b> The flirtatious tickling. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Whispering and tickling have their place in business. <br />  				<b>Darryl:</b> That thing were you softly exhale on her neck. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> I&#8230; Okay, yeah, that&#8217;s pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. <br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> Michael. Confession:</b> I have done PDA in the office. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Thank you. <br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> I&#8217;ve had intercourse in the office. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> All right. <br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> As has Angela!<br />  				<b>Angela:</b> Dwight! <br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly. <br />  				<b>Kevin:</b> As has Kevin!<br />  				<b>Angela:</b> With who?<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b> She goes to another school. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Okay. Fine. No more PDA. <br />  				<b>Oscar:</b> Good. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> You win. But here&#8217;s what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. <br />  				<b>Angela:</b> No. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Anything goes. <br />  				<b>Oscar:</b> Just leave it how you said&#8230;<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> Michael, that&#8217;s absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we&#8217;re gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Pro. <br />  				<b>Dwight:</b> Yes!<br />  				<b>Michael:</b> What? Problem solved.   				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Michael:</b> No, no, it&#8217;s great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.   				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Pam:</b> That&#8217;s weird. I mean, that&#8217;s weird to have sex in the office. That&#8217;s where you work, right? <br />  				<b>Jim:</b> Mm-hmm. <br />  				<b>Pam:</b> You know, you&#8217;re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you&#8217;ve had sex there, except for you and him. <br />  				<b>Jim:</b> [snorts] Ew.   				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Erin:</b> Don&#8217;t mind us. You keep working. <br />  				<b>Darryl:</b> Okay. I&#8217;ll keep working. <br />  				<b>Erin:</b> Oh, my God.

I think it&#8217;s okay. He doesn&#8217;t seem to hear us. <br />  				<b>Andy:</b> I think he can hear us. <br />  				<b>Andy:</b> [softly] That makes sense, &#8217;cause I feel like I&#8217;d be able to hear us at this level. <br />  				<b>Erin:</b> Darryl. <br />  				<b>Andy:</b> Darryl is a jerk. <br />  				<b>Erin:</b> No, he&#8217;s not. <br />  				<b>Andy:</b> No, I&#8217;m just testing if he can hear. <br />  				<b>Darryl:</b> I can hear you. <br />  				<b>Andy:</b> Oh. Okay. <br />  				<b>Erin:</b> Okay. Then no more talking. Let&#8217;s just play the song. <br />  				<b>Boom Box:</b> [Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.

<div class="quote">  				<b>Holly:</b> Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Ah, the old &#8220;leave behind.&#8221; Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it&#8217;s working. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> Oh, no. Michael, I don&#8217;t want to make people uncomfortable. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don&#8217;t&#8230; I don&#8217;t sit on your lap because it&#8217;s comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> Yeah, but if they&#8217;re uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we&#8217;ll stop. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> Okay.   				</div>

I can&#8217;t stop. You don&#8217;t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it&#8217;s reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One:</b> You&#8217;re taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I&#8217;ve done it, and I know the feeling. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> No, I don&#8217;t think so. <br />  				<b>Gabe:</b> Number two:</b> You&#8217;re desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua.

What&#8217;s wrong? <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> I haven&#8217;t thought about you having to go back to Nashua. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> Maybe we didn&#8217;t want to think about it. We can make it work. We&#8217;ll date long-distance. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> That&#8217;s what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How&#8217;s this gonna be any different? <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> We weren&#8217;t in love last time. <br />  				<b>Michael:</b> I was in love with you. <br />  				<b>Holly:</b> I&#8217;m not saying it won&#8217;t be hard.
