random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"

random_text[number++] = "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."
random_text[number++] = "I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
random_text[number++] = "Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ."
random_text[number++] = "You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."

random_text[number++] = "It's an epidemic."
random_text[number++] = "Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?"
random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."

random_text[number++] = "Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."

random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."

random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."

In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Really?<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  Yeah.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  [waiting for Fred to continue] &#8230;What is it?<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  Nice try.<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  I&#8217;m sorry, what is your three-step plan?<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  Well, I mean, I can&#8217;t just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you&#8217;ll get the plan.<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Well&#8230; it&#8217;s an interview, and we don&#8217;t know that you really have the plan.<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  [speaking faster] Well, I&#8217;m not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You&#8217;re in paper, right?<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  How would we know that, if you don&#8217;t&#8230;<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  You could just be saying it to get the job.<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  I guess I could be, if I was&#8230; who would do that?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  How about this. Why don&#8217;t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  Tell you what. I&#8217;ll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Okay.<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  Color-code sent documents, TM.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Did you just trademark that&#8230;<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  [confused] W-What?<br />  				<b>Fred:</b>  That&#8217;s a verbal trademark. That&#8217;s an agreement.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Jim:</b>  We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch&#8217;s new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone&#8217;s bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an &#8220;Andy for Manager?&#8221; pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I&#8217;m not too worried. But I&#8217;m really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe&#8217;s last name was Lewis? I had no idea.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Stanley:</b>  [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Good morning.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  [also to Darryl] Good morning.<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Good morning.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Did you have a nice drive in?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  I did.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Darryl:</b>  I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company&#8217;s owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt that I&#8217;m&#8230; [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Andy:</b>  [puts up a poster in the break room with &#8220;IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY&#8221; on it in bold lettering]<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  [commenting on the poster] It&#8217;s good. I really hope you get it!<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  The manager job? Nah, I&#8217;m barely interested. I just can&#8217;t not go for it. You know, it&#8217;s not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  Still, I&#8217;d really like to see this office with you in the boss&#8217;s chair.<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  Don&#8217;t even&#8230; [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  You in the boss&#8217;s chair!<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Andy:</b>  In my family, you don&#8217;t really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don&#8217;t know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and&#8230; [awkwardly smiling] we&#8217;ll see what Rosa comes back with.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Erin:</b>  [checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Oh, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but&#8230;<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky&#8217;s had come out.<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  Yeah. I&#8217;m sure I was just another Porky&#8217;s baby.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Mm.<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  But why not find out.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b> Yeah.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Pam:</b>  [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  They won&#8217;t make me manager, and I won&#8217;t settle for anything less. I&#8217;ve gone about as far as I can here. That&#8217;s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Warren Buffett:</b>  Can you do any better on salary?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.<br />  				<b>Warren:</b>  What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain&#8217;t cheap, you know.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.<br />  				<b>Warren:</b>  How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Angela:</b>  [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator&#8217;s office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b>  The Botanical Gardens, Scranton&#8217;s hidden gem. Don&#8217;t eat any berries you don&#8217;t recognize.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Toby:</b>  How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?<br />  				<b>Robert California:</b>  You don&#8217;t work in sales, do you.<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  Uh&#8230; Human Resources.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don&#8217;t be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don&#8217;t ever think there is. There is only&#8230; sex. Everything&#8230; is sex. You understand that what I&#8217;m telling you is a universal truth,&#8230; Toby.<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  Yes.<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Okay, I-I am, I&#8217;m almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Can you&#8230; [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence&#8230; would be&#8230; in a dialogue with a subordinate?<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Yes.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object&#8230; whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we&#8217;ve had already, you won&#8217;t be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Yes.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]   				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Jim:</b>  [Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Andy:</b>  [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl. <br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don&#8217;t see a bear drinking raccoon milk.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Oh? Uh&#8230; we haven&#8217;t started the interview yet. Were you&#8211;were you joking?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Uh&#8230; [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  I thought that was your job.<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  Well, it&#8217;s one of my strengths, but it&#8217;s the manager&#8217;s job.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  I&#8217;ll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions&#8230; and consequences&#8230; of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who&#8217;s that?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  [ignoring Darryl&#8217;s question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we&#8217;ll be good right?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  I&#8230; I just thought you knew me.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Yeah, it&#8217;s no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Let me&#8230; [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Merv Bronte:</b>  [at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  Ohh, unfortunately, yes.<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  What do you mean?<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  That business can&#8217;t attract anyone. It&#8217;s awful up there. Those people seem like they&#8217;re in prison, waiting out life sentences in a&#8230; dying industry.<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  Place must be horrible. I don&#8217;t know if I want this job. [gets on elevator]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Merv:</b>  [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I&#8217;m gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I&#8217;m never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna die here.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Dwight:</b>  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  I just did.<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  You can&#8217;t.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  It&#8217;s done.<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  No, it&#8217;s not.<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>   I know you now, your nature. I&#8217;m done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:</b>  You don&#8217;t know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it&#8217;s made?<br />  				<b>Robert:</b>  I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  [standing up] Get out.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Dwight:</b>  I&#8217;m gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That&#8217;s because I just threw it in the ring.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Merv:</b>  You guys pay for relocation, though, right?<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  Well, I&#8217;d want to move further away, you know? Just&#8230; I don&#8217;t want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Can I ask why you&#8217;re leaving your current job?<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I&#8217;m leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of &#8217;em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just&#8230; I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Is this a bad time to be doing this?<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  I&#8217;m having a bad time. [chuckles]<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  I&#8217;m sorry, if we did something to upset you, I&#8217;m sure it was inadvertent.<br />  				<b>Merv:</b>  [continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Merv:</b>  Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Angela:</b>  [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Pam:</b>  [looking at an engagement ring on Angela&#8217;s finger] It&#8217;s gorgeous, Angela.<br />  				<b>Kelly:</b>  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.<br />  				<b>Meredith:</b>  [looks at ring, whispering] Wow&#8230;<br />  				<b>Angela:</b>  It&#8217;s a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?<br />  				<b>Meredith:</b>  Tell us the freaking story!<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b>  Yeah! Tell us a story.<br />  				<b>Angela:</b>  Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet&#8217;s Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator&#8217;s wife?<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?<br />  				<b>Angela:</b>  Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim&#8217;s voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  That&#8217;s not accurate.<br />  				<b>Angela:</b>  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Oscar:</b>  Angela&#8217;s engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I&#8217;m horrified. As a friend of Angela&#8217;s, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I&#8217;m a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Jim:</b>  Andy? You all set?<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  Okay, guys, it&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  [grunts] Augh.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Erin:</b>  I think Andy should be the boss. He&#8217;s just so great. If I&#8217;m being objective, then Darryl, of course.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Jim:</b>  So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here&#8230; [gets cut off by Gabe]<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Whoa! That&#8217;s a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  I wasn&#8217;t acc-, accusing&#8230;<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Well, Toby&#8217;s in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby&#8217;s done a fine job.<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  Right! I really wasn&#8217;t trying to insult any, anyone.<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  I didn&#8217;t think you were.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Gabe:</b>  I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he&#8217;s a rat, and I think he&#8217;s responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,&#8230; he broke up the happiest couple in this office!  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Gabe:</b>  How many windows are there in New York City?<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  What?<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Critical thinking.

And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and&#8230; [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,&#8230;<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Andy:</b>  [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!  				</div>

You&#8217;ve changed your mind? You&#8217;re now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]  				</div>

A homeless person.<br />  				<b>Ryan:</b>  No, you&#8217;re right, Pam, let&#8217;s just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  No, I want you to say that you think the &#8216;best&#8217; person to be our new manager is a homeless person.<br />  				<b>Ryan:</b>  Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Ryan:</b>  I got away with&#8230; everything, under the last boss, and it wasn&#8217;t good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don&#8217;t just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me&#8230; when I&#8217;m in the mood&#8230; to be led.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Meredith:</b>  I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  Hey! Hey! Hey!<br />  				<b>Meredith:</b>  Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let&#8217;s hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  She may have a point there&#8230; would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  [walks in] Gotta catch a plane.<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  Ohh, hey Gabe, I&#8217;m sorry, we&#8230; we didn&#8217;t get you a cake or anything. We&#8217;re gonna miss you.<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Oh, well I&#8217;m still the corporate liaison to the branch.<br />  				<b>Kelly:</b>  You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  Okay, you know what, you don&#8217;t need to make that sound.<br />  				<b>Kelly:</b>  I&#8217;m sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!<br />  				<b>Gabe:</b>  There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I&#8217;m a terrific hugger. I&#8217;ve been with a bunch of girls where that&#8217;s basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b>  Later, man.<br />  				<b>All:</b>  [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job. <br />  				<b>Ryan:</b>  Take care, man.<br />  				<b>Dwight:</b>  We&#8217;re gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]<br />  				<b>Andy:</b>  [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I&#8217;m educated. I&#8217;m capable. I like all of you&#8230; and I won&#8217;t make any changes.<br />  				<b>Erin:</b>  I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I&#8217;m standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I&#8217;m like&#8230;<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin&#8217;s hair with her hand]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  No, we&#8217;re not related. I got the call. But&#8230; I&#8217;ll tell her some other day. [smiles]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Jim:</b>  What about Darryl? We can all agree that he&#8217;s a stand-up guy, right?<br />  				<b>Angela:</b>  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there&#8217;s a great, lively debate here, but let&#8217;s think about-<br />  				<b>Toby:</b>  No, no,&#8230; no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]<br />  				<b>Kevin:</b>  Exactly.<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn&#8217;t disrupt your meeting.<br />  				<b>Jada:</b>  Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.<br />  				<b>Jada:</b>  I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;d be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he&#8217;s a really great dad!<br />  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let&#8217;s go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  What? No, no, it&#8217;s not a vote.<br />  				<b>Phyllis:</b>  Then what was this all about?<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  I don&#8217;t know. This conversation really got away from me.<br />  				<b>Kelly:</b>  I don&#8217;t care. They can just vote.<br />  				<b>Jim:</b>  No, they can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We&#8217;re going in this room, we&#8217;re going to have a meeting. We&#8217;re gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she&#8217;s gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Andy:</b>  Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I&#8217;m about to do that.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Nellie:</b>  This job? Oh, yeah, I&#8217;ll get it. Jo&#8217;s an old friend. I think&#8230; I&#8217;m her best friend. She&#8217;s not my best friend.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Darryl:</b>  Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin&#8230; especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Fred:</b>  No, I&#8217;ve never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of&#8230; [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Merv:</b>  Honestly, I think I&#8230; I sabotaged myself. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m afraid of being happy. Case in point&#8230; I was supposed to start another job today.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Robert:</b>  [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That&#8217;s a&#8230; call I&#8217;ve received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause&#8230; while they wait to hear my response, and then&#8230; my response.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Finger Lakes Guy:</b>  [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It&#8217;s just, the rest of my family&#8217;s in the Finger Lakes right now. I&#8217;m supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they&#8217;ll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Dwight:</b>  I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or&#8230; [shrugs] I don&#8217;t know. Something always works out. [leaves]  				</div>
<div class="quote">  				<b>Creed:</b>  You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?<br />  				<b>Creed:</b>  I think you two should meet.<br />  				<b>Pam:</b>  Well, okay!<br />  				<b>Creed:</b>  Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]<br />  				<b>Pam as &#8220;fourth-biggest client&#8221;:</b>  [in a comedic male voice] Hello! <br />  				<b>Pam as &#8220;ninth-biggest client&#8221;:</b>  [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!<br />  				<b>Pam as &#8220;fourth-biggest client&#8221;:</b>  Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]<br />  				<b>Pam as &#8220;ninth-biggest client&#8221;:</b>  Ohho! I&#8217;m good! Don&#8217;t you just love paper, and things about paper!<br />  				<b>Pam as &#8220;fourth-biggest client&#8221;:</b>  Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!<br />  				<b>Creed:</b>  It&#8217;s Kismet!   				</div>
