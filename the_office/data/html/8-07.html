random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"
random_text[number++] = "Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman."
random_text[number++] = "That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you."
random_text[number++] = "I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?"
random_text[number++] = "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."
random_text[number++] = "I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
random_text[number++] = "Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ."
random_text[number++] = "You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."
random_text[number++] = "I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third."

random_text[number++] = "Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
random_text[number++] = "It's an epidemic."
random_text[number++] = "Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?"
random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
random_text[number++] = "I think green is kind of whoreish."

random_text[number++] = "Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."
random_text[number++] = "The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion."
random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."
random_text[number++] = "Let's go. The men's room was disgusting."

I’m not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Who’s calling?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Nobody. Just say that I&#8217;m-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I’m going to refuse to take it.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> You’re not going to take it?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Just make up a phone call. It’s not a real call. Make it up.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Ohohohoh.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> And come and tell me. Doesn’t matter what it is.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> You’re not going to get it though?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I’m not going to take it.

It’ll have to wait.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Are you sure? It’s really, really important.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Really? Because your mother is dead.  <br /><b>Client:</b> Oh my God.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I don’t think she’s dead.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> She’s dead. She was hit by a bus.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> She’s not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> This isn’t one of those times. It’s the police. They said it’s the worst they’ve ever seen.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Andy I’m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.  <br /><b>Client:</b> Oh you must take this call. It&#8217;s…  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah. Um line 1?  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Line 2.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Hi.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b>[on phone]It’s Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Ooh, gosh!  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Dude.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Officer.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Look man this is a bad idea.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Did she have any last words or?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Really? That is messed up man.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> You’re a bad man Andy Bernard.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> That is so mom.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> That stuff can come back to get you. It’s called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle…  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Hey Cathy.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> Hi.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> How’s it going? Everything make sense?  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> I think everything is under control.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Great.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> You should sit down.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Oh no, I’m fine.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> No I should go fill out my paperwork.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Oh we know.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> I’m training a temp to be my replacement while I’m on maternity leave. Oh I should’ve mentioned I’m pregnant. You probably didn’t notice because it’s impossible to tell I’m so small. But yeah I’m pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Ryan:</b> Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Hmm. Doubt it.  <br /><b>Ryan:</b> Yeah me too.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> You doubt it?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> What’s that?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Why do you doubt that she’s single?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we’d save her from Ryan right?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Darryl:</b> What are you doing with my lunch?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I’m delivering it from the fridge. It’s like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> It’s not pizza.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah and we’re not about to make love. I just thought maybe you’d want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Ryan:</b> So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Well he’s probably a drug dealer. That’s the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.  <br /><b>Toby:</b> It’s going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.  <br /><b>Offscreen:</b> Good energy  <br /><b>Pam:</b> It’s going to be good to have someone hot at Pam’s desk huh?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> No, no. Not even.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I’m kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She’s obviously super cute I get it. But I’d like to point out there’s 50 pounds more of me to love if that’s your thing.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.  <br /><b>Toby:</b> Radiant.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> Yeah you have this sexy glow.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> It’s one of the most common fetishes.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Really well thank you all.  <br /><b>Toby:</b> You know it’s not just pregnant women who don’t get their due. You know who’s gorgeous? Helen Mirren.  <br /><b>Ryan:</b> Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?  <br /><b>Toby:</b> You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It’s a pregnant Helen Mirren.  <br />[everyone agrees]  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you’re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> In this case yes.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> No we’re not.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That’s right. You’re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.   </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> [scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Nice scatting, man.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.  <br /><b>Val:</b> Not bad fellas, you&#8217;re better than you look.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Hey, screw you!  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well we&#8217;re all musicians and we play together sometimes.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> You&#8217;re a band.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Thank you.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> We&#8217;re called Kevin and the Zits.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> That was never agreed upon.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> I miss being in a band.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> I have a tambourine.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Tambourine? You know I’m the CEO, right?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [to Kevin] CEOs don&#8217;t play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Great!  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Again, never agreed upon.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you&#8217;re in a rock and roll band with somebody, you&#8217;re bonded for life!  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Usually that life is short and tragic. That&#8217;s okay, right?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, even cooler.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> We all got to go sometime.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Hey.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Hey.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Helen Mirren. Hot?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Yeah. Super pretty.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Huh. What about Cathy?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> The temp?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yeah. Do you think she&#8217;s hot?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Nope.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I&#8217;m not asking if you&#8217;re in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> And I&#8217;m telling you, I don&#8217;t.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> You don&#8217;t find Cathy attractive?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> No, I don&#8217;t.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> No, I&#8217;m not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I’m not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It&#8217;s true, but it doesn&#8217;t help anybody.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay. Uh, I don&#8217;t. So are we good? [Jim leaves]  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> That&#8217;s just absurd.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yes, because she&#8217;s hot, right?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you&#8217;re a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren&#8217;t true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who&#8217;s telling me the truth.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Dwight, am I hot right now?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Why would I or anyone else think that you&#8217;re hot right now? I can&#8217;t impregnate you, and that&#8217;s the driving force between male-female attraction.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> What about before? Was I attractive before?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Meh&#8230; you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you&#8217;re at an all-time low.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Hmm. I think Jim’s lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You think Jim’s lying? [laughs] That&#8217;s so cute. I know he&#8217;s lying.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yep, that&#8217;s the Dwight I need.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> If we&#8217;re going to work together, we need some ground rules.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Okay.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I think so. Okay.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Rule two: we stop at nothing.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Well, what does that&#8230; is that&#8230; okay.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Rule three: Don&#8217;t fall in love.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yep, good.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> We&#8217;re gonna bust this guy.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Honesty is very important to me.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Let&#8217;s just see how we feel when we get there.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Kelly:</b> Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don&#8217;t want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> None taken. What do you got?  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy&#8217;s hot.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Hmm.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Robert:</b> [to the keyboardist, Curtis, and the drummer] Hey, you found us!  <br /><b>Curtis:</b> You guys sound great, man.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> [to drummer] Dude, you&#8217;re on TV! You’re the sportscaster on channel seven.  <br /><b>Drummer:</b> Go Eagles! [laughs]  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> You do that on TV!  <br /><b>Robert:</b> You guys mind if they join us?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah, absolutely!  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Guys, I&#8217;ve got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and güiro]  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Hey, why don&#8217;t you and me play those?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> What should we play?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Maybe we should warm up with some scales?  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Midnight Rambler?  <br /><b>Curtis:</b> Yeah.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Midnight what?  <br /><b>Curtis:</b> [singing] Have you heard about the midnight rambler? [Lisa, the guitarist, enters] Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, I stand corrected.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Mike Tibbets, really?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Mm-hmm.  <br /><b>Ryan:</b> Hey, who&#8217;s this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Not his mom&#8217;s car.  <br /><b>Ryan:</b> Yeah, &#8217;cause his mom&#8217;s car&#8217;s probably not a Nissan Z.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Touche?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Kelly:</b> [sees photo of Mike Tibbets] Eww!  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Kelly, calm down.  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> I mean, I guess he&#8217;d be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he&#8217;ll get hair plugs.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I don&#8217;t think Jim cares about his hair.  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It&#8217;s called being a nice person.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s so ugly about him. He&#8217;s got the broad face of a brewer.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Jim&#8217;s on to me.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Hmm?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Just ugly enough to have deniability.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Yep.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I&#8217;m in the clear. If that wasn&#8217;t for the matchmaker test, then&#8230; Cathy, he&#8217;s a really nice guy.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can&#8217;t lie with his body.  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> I&#8217;m gonna write something mean on his wall.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> No, Kelly, don&#8217;t.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.  <br /><b>Pam and Kelly:</b> With the crotch?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> With the crotch.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Kevin:</b> [music plays] Whoo!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Psst. We&#8217;re not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]  <br /><b>Creed:</b> Who said that?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Exactly.  <br /><b>Creed:</b> How&#8217;d I get this long triangle?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Okay, just shut it.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Is he puffing out his chest?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I can&#8217;t tell. It&#8217;s unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> No. Maybe he just said something funny.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> I think he&#8217;s just making her laugh.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Time for me to find out.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Why&#8217;s he making her laugh so much?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I&#8217;m slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim&#8217;s crotch]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Dwight!  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> Are you okay?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;m totally fine.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Dwight! Dwight!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight&#8217;s hands away] Wha- Jim.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> [to Cathy] Sorry about that.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Aw, cramp, I&#8217;m just- [grabs Jim&#8217;s crotch again]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Dwight! [pushes Dwight&#8217;s hands away] Why?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I&#8217;m sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Leave.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> [to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Why was he making her laugh so much?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Oh, hey, I&#8217;ll just be a second.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> Yeah, take your time.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Okay.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> [to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Mm-hmm?  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> [laughs] Told you.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Oscar, Cathy has a question!  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> Sorry, um, I&#8217;ll just go ask Oscar.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> [to Jim] Yeah?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You okay?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Why won&#8217;t you just admit that she&#8217;s attractive? It&#8217;s kind of annoying that you won&#8217;t say it.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that&#8217;s where we are now.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> She called it crazy? Aw, man, that&#8217;s insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Yeah, its nuts. But I don&#8217;t know what else to do.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> And she called it nuts?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Darryl:</b> Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Mm-hmm.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Are you serious? From Star Trek?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> [to Val] Hey, you caught some of that?  <br /><b>Val:</b> I caught it.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> What, you don&#8217;t like the blues?  <br /><b>Val:</b> I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well, we are playing. We&#8217;re all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It&#8217;s a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]  <br /><b>Val:</b> I think the music left without you.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Come on.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Stop shoving me.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> [mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> [to Pam] Really?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.  <br /><b>Old Man:</b> Uh, are you all in line?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Why don&#8217;t you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I&#8217;m going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Si.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Wait, that&#8217;s it? That&#8217;s the question you&#8217;re going to ask him?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.  <br /><b>Old Man:</b> You have to share the machine with others.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> [mimicking] Well, that&#8217;s what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.  <br /><b>Old Man:</b> Thank you.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Jim, are you serious?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Maybe we could switch instruments.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Yeah.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> &#8216;Cause, uh, my body&#8217;s starting to get bruised.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> We had to leave because of creative differences.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn&#8217;t really fit in with our thing.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Guys, this means they&#8217;re Kevin and the Zits now.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> No man, we are.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well-  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> No, no, no.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> [to old man] Okay, you&#8217;re done.  <br /><b>Old Man:</b> I have a new heart, you know.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Jim:</b> No, I&#8217;m not worried. Because this lie isn&#8217;t for me, it&#8217;s for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back&#8230; yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven&#8217;t had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> No.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yep, he&#8217;s lying.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Ah, see, was that so hard?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I am not lying.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Really?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he&#8217;s lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Wait, what?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Look at the numbers. Every single time, it&#8217;s come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Jim, you have high blood pressure.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Doesn&#8217;t your dad have high blood pressure?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Yeah, but I don&#8217;t smoke.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> When was the last time you went to the doctor?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I don&#8217;t know.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> It&#8217;s important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Dwight, stop. I&#8217;m not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay, easy. Trust me, I&#8217;m around for the long-haul.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> It&#8217;s not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay.  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Come on, let&#8217;s go. I wanna call your doctor.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Doesn&#8217;t it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?  <br /><b>Pam:</b> Just go home. It doesn&#8217;t matter.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> But&#8230; hey, Cece&#8217;s toothbrush.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Thank you.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy and Darryl:</b> Oh baby I love your way.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Every day.  <br /><b>Andy and Darryl:</b> Wanna be with you night and day.  <br /><b>Darryl and Kevin:</b> And day.  <br /><b>Andy and Darryl:</b> Oh baby I love your way.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.  </div>
