random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"

random_text[number++] = "That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you."

random_text[number++] = "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."
random_text[number++] = "I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
random_text[number++] = "Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ."
random_text[number++] = "You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."

random_text[number++] = "Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection."
random_text[number++] = "It's an epidemic."
random_text[number++] = "Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?"
random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?"
random_text[number++] = "I think green is kind of whoreish."

random_text[number++] = "Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."
random_text[number++] = "The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion."
random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."

So much energy&#8230; There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Toby:</b> Morning.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Mornin&#8217;. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I&#8217;m going to set my watch alarm&#8230; And&#8230; [watch beeps]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Toby:</b> Good morning, Kelly.<br />  <b>Kelly:</b> I can&#8217;t believe this is your last day. How do you feel?<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Fine. Good.<br />  <b>Kelly:</b> I feel weird.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Michael:</b> First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby&#8217;s going away party.<br />  <b>Angela:</b> We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Okay.<br />  <b>Angela:</b> But so far we only have two pictures of him.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets&#8230;<br />  <b>Pam:</b> Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans&#8217; funeral?<br />  <b>Michael:</b> If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?<br />  <b>Angela:</b> Michael&#8230;<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-<br />  <b>Angela:</b> No. You know-no!<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Toga!<br />  <b>Angela:</b> You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides&#8230; although Toby won&#8217;t be in them.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Michael:</b> Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year&#8230; uh, as Nana starts to&#8230; but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn&#8217;t know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. &#8220;Michael, buy a motorcycle.&#8221; So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Michael:</b> I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this&#8230; ugly weight holding me down, you know?&#8230; I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.<br />  <b>Pam:</b> So how much antigravity potion do you want?<br />  <b>Angela:</b> No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don&#8217;t want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Phyllis, can you do this?<br />  <b>Phyllis:</b> [whispers] Yes.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Hi, can I help you?<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Hi. Yes, uh, I&#8217;m Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Toby:</b> As part of my last day I&#8217;m training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Toby:</b> So this is H.R. This is your desk.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> I love the view.<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Yeah, it&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it?  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek]<br />  <b>Jim:</b> Hey&#8230; What?<br />  <b>Pam:</b> Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.<br />  <b>Jim:</b> No way! What did I say? I said that they&#8217;d love those sketches. Congratulations!<br />  <b>Pam:</b> Oh, thank you! I don&#8217;t know why I doubted it, because I&#8217;m so clearly awesome!<br />  <b>Jim:</b> Yes! So when do you start?<br />  <b>Pam:</b> I don&#8217;t know, I didn&#8217;t read it carefully, I just saw &#8220;congratulations&#8221; and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.<br />  <b>Jim:</b> Wow. Busy morning.<br />  <b>Pam:</b> So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months&#8230;<br />  <b>Jim:</b> It&#8217;s not a big deal. I&#8217;ll come visit you. And you&#8217;ll visit me. It&#8217;s only two hours away. It&#8217;ll be fine. That part&#8217;s gonna suck, but it&#8217;ll be great.<br />  <b>Pam:</b> Yeah, it sucks, but it&#8217;ll be great.<br />  <b>Jim:</b> See how easy that is?<br />  <b>Pam:</b> Ohh&#8230; [they hug; she laughs]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Pam:</b> I wouldn&#8217;t go if things weren&#8217;t so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn&#8217;t go then either. So, the timing&#8217;s perfect&#8230; And that is the first time I&#8217;ve ever used the word &#8220;perfect&#8221; in here!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Toby:</b> Hey, Stanley&#8230;<br />  <b>Stanley:</b> Hmm?<br />  <b>Toby:</b> I want to introduce you to&#8230;<br />  <b>Michael:</b> [watching from his office] Toby&#8217;s replacement. Ugh. Wow.<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> So what do we know about her?<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Well, we know that Toby thinks she&#8217;ll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> I hate her too.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Why do you hate her?<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> Because she&#8230; stinks&#8230; with her&#8230; ways&#8230; and her&#8230; head.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> You know, Dwight, sometimes&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I think you say things just to agree with me.<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> Would that be such a bad thing?<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> What?<br />  <b>Michael:</b> We need to sell her an elevator pass.<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> But our, our elevator doesn&#8217;t require a pa&#8230; [gasps]<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Phyllis:</b> Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?<br />  <b>Woman over speakerphone:</b> Antigravity machines?<br />  <b>Phyllis:</b> That&#8217;s right. Yeah.<br />  <b>Woman over speakerphone:</b> What do they do exactly?<br />  <b>Phyllis:</b> They make you feel lighter&#8230;<br />  <b>Woman over speakerphone:</b> Antigravity&#8230; Um&#8230; Anti&#8230;depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.<br />  <b>Phyllis:</b> Okay.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Michael:</b> [knock on door] Yeah.<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Hey Michael.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Oh, hey, do you still work here?<br />  <b>Toby:</b> I&#8217;d like to introduce you to my replacement.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Nah.<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Come on.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> No. I think I will pass.<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Michael Scott, this is Holly.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Hi.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here&#8217;s how things work here:</b> my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert:</b> I&#8217;m gonna win.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Man, someone doesn&#8217;t like H.R.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Yeah.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> [to Toby] What did you do to him?<br />  <b>Toby:</b> Nothing.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> T-No. He tortured me&#8230; with his awfulness.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I&#8217;ll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Y-You can-Michael.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Michael:</b> Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she&#8217;s just an awesome woman from this planet.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Creed:</b> [shaking Holly&#8217;s hand] The pleasure&#8217;s all mine.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Oh, thanks. I&#8217;m really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.<br />  <b>Creed:</b> Any time.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> What do you do here?<br />  <b>Creed:</b> &#8230;Excuse me.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Creed:</b> What is wrong with this woman? She&#8217;s asking about stuff that&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business. &#8220;What do I do?&#8221;&#8230; Really, what do I do here? I should&#8217;ve written it down. &#8220;Qua&#8221; something, uh&#8230; qua&#8230; quar&#8230; quibo, qual&#8230;quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I&#8217;m getting close.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?<br />  <b>Holly:</b> No. Which one&#8217;s Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle]<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> He&#8217;s here on a special work program. He&#8217;s slow, you know, in his brain.<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Oh. Good for you guys.<br />  <b>Dwight:</b> Yeah.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.  </div>

Are these guys boring your ears off?<br />  <b>Holly:</b> No, no, I&#8230;<br />  <b>Michael:</b> Oh&#8230; What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Ooh, uh&#8230;<br />  <b>Michael:</b> You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?<br />  <b>Holly:</b> Um&#8230; Y-yeah.

I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and&#8230; Look, all I&#8217;m saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.  </div>

Which is what we refer to in the business as &#8220;misleading the shareholders.&#8221; Another good term is &#8220;fraud.&#8221; The real crime, I think, was the beard.  </div>

Um, I take it out when I get stressed or depressed, and it really calms me down.  Never thought I&#8217;d get to live here, you know.  But it turns out they built these great new condos there, so, this could be me, right around, uh, where the trees used to be.  </div>
