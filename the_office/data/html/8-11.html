random_text[number++] = "Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you. "
random_text[number++] = "I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. "
random_text[number++] = "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that."
random_text[number++] = "Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! FALSE. I do not miss him."
random_text[number++] = "No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?"
random_text[number++] = "You don't call retarded people 'retards'. It's bad taste. You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded."
random_text[number++] = "Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude."
random_text[number++] = "I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?"

random_text[number++] = "The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."
random_text[number++] = "That's what she said.  Or he said."
random_text[number++] = "I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself, but is he concerned about downsizing?"
random_text[number++] = "No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer."
random_text[number++] = "Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ."
random_text[number++] = "You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin."

random_text[number++] = "Hey, hey, everybody. Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh!"
random_text[number++] = "OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?"
random_text[number++] = "See I learned improv from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles."

random_text[number++] = "Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath."
random_text[number++] = "One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision."
random_text[number++] = "He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious."
random_text[number++] = "You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself."
random_text[number++] = "I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box."
random_text[number++] = "And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt."
random_text[number++] = "Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine."
random_text[number++] = "Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0."
random_text[number++] = "Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies."
random_text[number++] = "I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike."
random_text[number++] = "Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that."
random_text[number++] = "Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?"
random_text[number++] = "Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? "
random_text[number++] = "I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts?"
random_text[number++] = "Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I.  I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame."
random_text[number++] = "Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great."
random_text[number++] = "Who? Dave Barry?"
random_text[number++] = "It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk."
random_text[number++] = "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it."
random_text[number++] = "And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!"
random_text[number++] = "This says 'Bushiest Beaver.'"
random_text[number++] = "No, no. Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!"
random_text[number++] = "And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WOOOOOOOO!"
random_text[number++] = "I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms."
random_text[number++] = "Every so often, Jim dies of boredom."
random_text[number++] = "You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here I try to throw things in it."
random_text[number++] = "You try and hurt Mozart, you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. "
random_text[number++] = "Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies."
random_text[number++] = "Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'"
random_text[number++] = "We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex."
random_text[number++] = "Yeah, I got a game. It's called work hard so my kids can go to college."
random_text[number++] = "I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants."
random_text[number++] = "If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people."
random_text[number++] = "Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton."
random_text[number++] = "There's a basic principle in real estate. That you should never be the best looking person in the development."
random_text[number++] = "Question. Where can I put my terrarium?"
random_text[number++] = "I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you."
random_text[number++] = "Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. "
random_text[number++] = "Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy."
random_text[number++] = "Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom. Gay friendly."
random_text[number++] = "No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble."
random_text[number++] = "You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?"
random_text[number++] = "I tried hopping Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance."
random_text[number++] = "Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to"
random_text[number++] = "Ok, see you later, Pan."
random_text[number++] = "Pam, please.  I have Country Crock."
random_text[number++] = "Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!"
random_text[number++] = "Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. And he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel."
random_text[number++] = "He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works."
random_text[number++] = "I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill."
random_text[number++] = "You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick..."

random_text[number++] = "Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese."
random_text[number++] = "You can't fire me.  I don't work in this van!"
random_text[number++] = "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?"
random_text[number++] = "Me so horny. Me love you long tim."
random_text[number++] = "Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?"
random_text[number++] = "I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'"
random_text[number++] = "Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down."
random_text[number++] = "Let's go. The men's room was disgusting."

<div class="quote">  [No one is talking in the office, Jim holds up sign that reads “We&#8217;re on the longest silent streak in office history! Nobody has said anything in&#8230; 14 min!”, Dwight hangs up on a phone call rather than speak, Andy sees a raccoon eating a hamburger and tries to describe it using charades, Kevin opens a candy bar and takes a bite]  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Oh yeah!  <br /><b>All:</b> Aw!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> You really have to say &#8220;oh yeah&#8221; every time you eat a candy bar?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> I can&#8217;t help it, Oscar. It&#8217;s just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!  <br /><b>Jim:</b> All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let&#8217;s try again. Get it all out now if you have to.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it&#8217;s going to drive me insane.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay, done.  <br /><b>Erin:</b> [shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit?  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Check out this song I wrote: I&#8217;ma love you downstairs tonight&#8230; [overlapping chatter]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> [writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> You can write a book about chairs.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Books! Excellent, Jim.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-  <br /><b>Andy:</b> [gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don&#8217;t know what paper is.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I&#8217;m talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let&#8217;s get high on our own supply!  <br /><b>Angela:</b> Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yes!  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That&#8217;s today. And we&#8217;re eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can&#8217;t afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that&#8217;s in my garage.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven&#8217;t managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Dwight Schrute for Robert California!  <br /><b>Receptionist:</b> Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I&#8217;ll tell him you&#8217;re here. Can I get you anything at all?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> I&#8217;m not here to be given anything. I&#8217;m here to take what is mine.  <br /><b>Receptionist:</b> Ooh. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re on our team. Here, please have a seat.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Dwight? What are you doing here?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Gabe? You don&#8217;t know?  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Course I know.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel&#8217;s office.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Gabe:</b> Corporate says to me, “Gabe, we need you in Scranton.” Scranton says, “Gabe, go back down to Florida. You&#8217;re needed there.” So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I&#8217;m up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I&#8217;m down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Robert:</b> Dwight.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Robert.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> You made it.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yes.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Impressive initiative.

<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they&#8217;re willing to &#8220;play ball.&#8221; Those were his words.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!  <br /><b>Andy:</b> So make that error!  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Andy, no-  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Hey! I can make that error.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> [clicks tongue] Aw&#8230;  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Well, it&#8217;s just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it&#8217;s a little more complicated than that.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> No, I-  <br /><b>Andy:</b> It&#8217;s just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> I&#8217;m leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Oh.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!  <br /><b>Andy:</b> What?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> It&#8217;s only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There&#8217;s a thousand dollar prize. I&#8217;m committed to my friends, they&#8217;re committed to me.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> You know what? Go. Have fun.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Andy:</b> There&#8217;s a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Stop right there. I love it.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> I&#8217;m in.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I didn&#8217;t even say what it is.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> It&#8217;s trivia.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> In Philadelphia.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> But here&#8217;s the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase&#8230;  <br /><b>Jim:</b> That&#8217;s a great idea.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> That&#8217;s a great plan.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Yeah? You like it?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Yeah.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> All right.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> All right, good stuff.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I&#8217;m so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, &#8220;this sounds really stupid.&#8221;  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> You just made a good idea, a great idea.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> There is one problem with this plan.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> What?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> We&#8217;d have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Gabe:</b> [on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we&#8217;re going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You&#8217;re the bagel guy.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question: What&#8217;s the most important appliance in your house?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Meat grinder.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> [makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It&#8217;s the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You&#8217;re an American classic.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I&#8217;m afraid. I&#8217;m not going to be able to meet with you, but I&#8217;m leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> But I can give you this pitch in one minute-  <br /><b>Robert:</b> No, he&#8217;s going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don&#8217;t want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He&#8217;s a great person to know. I&#8217;ll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Still an important position. Still a chief.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> You&#8217;re really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe&#8217;s phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Gabe, listen to me. Don&#8217;t bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight&#8217;s pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Your wish is my command.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> It&#8217;s a command.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Oscar:</b> I don&#8217;t believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> What? No!  <br /><b>Andy:</b> I&#8217;ve got a quota to hit. I don&#8217;t care how I hit it.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> And you guys thought this was a good idea?  <br /><b>Jim:</b> I thought it was a fun idea.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That&#8217;s the thing about long drives, you know, you&#8217;re always going to- this is a gay bar.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Yes! It&#8217;s a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?  <br /><b>All:</b> No. Nah.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you&#8217;re going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar&#8217;s trivia night? [laughs]  <br /><b>Andy:</b> It says that I believe that my staff&#8217;s intelligence and that I&#8217;m willing to try anything. [Oscar’s friend walks up] Not anything.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Good luck.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it&#8217;s winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> Good-timers follow me.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]  <br /><b>Stanley:</b> Go on, kid. You know you don&#8217;t belong here.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> A-team.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Okay.  <br /><b>Andy:</b> All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except&#8230; [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Okay. [leaves]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> There&#8217;s a table over here.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Host:</b> All right, first question everyone: Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Oh, we got this!  <br /><b>Creed:</b> Let&#8217;s reverse engineer this. You&#8217;re a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you&#8217;re a novelty. Alaska?  <br /><b>Stanley:</b> Atlanta.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> Oh I know you think that, because that&#8217;s where the Olympics were held.  <br /><b>Cathy:</b> My cousins were actually at those Olympics.  <br /><b>Stanley:</b> Keep talking all you want.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.  <br /><b>Host:</b> Okay, time&#8217;s up. Let&#8217;s get the boards up. &#8220;Atlanta, Georgia&#8221; is the correct answer. [Kevin holds up “What is&#8230;SEE-attle”]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Gabe:</b> Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> [sniffs] There&#8217;s no fires within eight miles of here.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Well, it&#8217;s nine miles away. I&#8217;m going to be meeting with you on his behalf.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO&#8217;s office on the phone this instant!  <br /><b>Receptionist:</b> This must be very frustrating.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> I can see you in the jungle now.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Host:</b> Okay, now, you&#8217;re not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA&#8217;s Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?  <br /><b>Andy:</b> Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Shawn Marion.  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Yes, Shawn Marion.  <br /><b>Ryan:</b> That doesn&#8217;t sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Wrong, for so many reasons.  <br /><b>Phyllis:</b> Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor&#8217;s sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?  <br /><b>Stanley:</b> That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m going to go watch the boats on the river.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Ron Artest, Kelly.  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> No, it&#8217;s Lamar Odom. If it&#8217;d been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he&#8217;s at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.  <br /><b>Host:</b> All right, boards up. Let&#8217;s see who got it. &#8220;Lamar Odom&#8221; is what we were looking for. &#8220;Lamar Odom&#8221; Thank you. [scattered cheers]  <br /><b>Jim:</b> Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Nicely done!  <br /><b>Andy:</b> You&#8217;re my sports guys! You&#8217;re ESPN, you&#8217;re ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC.

<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> So it&#8217;s a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!  <br /><b>Receptionist:</b> Well, you got my vote.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Oh my God.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> I know.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> What?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> What&#8217;s with the smile?  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> You&#8217;re doing great. You know, so good.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe&#8217;s arm] Ow!  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Take me to Robert.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Ow! He went home.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Take me to his house.  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> Uh, it&#8217;s a condo and it&#8217;s long-term business housing.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> You know where it is.

[leaves]  <br /><b>Host:</b> All right, guys. After nine rounds, let&#8217;s check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it&#8217;s Aesop&#8217;s Foibles. [Oscar&#8217;s team touches fingers] The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points.  <br /><b>Jim:</b> [claps] All right.  <br /><b>Host:</b> D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. [the &#8220;just-for-fun” Dunder-Mifflin team cheers] Ladies Gaga have five points. [more cheering]  <br /><b>Andy:</b> So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Dwight:</b> Which one is it?  <br /><b>Gabe:</b> I don&#8217;t know. All I know is the building.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Robert! Robert California! Robert!  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Host:</b> All right guys, time&#8217;s up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That&#8217;s all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let&#8217;s get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Oh yeah!  <br /><b>Kelly:</b> What! [cheers]  <br /><b>Host:</b> In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears.   <br /><b>Queerenstein Bears:</b> Whoo! Let&#8217;s go!  <br /><b>Host:</b> And, in first place, is Aesop&#8217;s Foibles.  <br /><b>Oscar&#8217;s friend:</b> Whoo!  <br /><b>Darryl:</b> Yeah, we&#8217;re going to get clobbered.  <br /><b>Host:</b> Ring it in when you know it. First question: This man had a fatwa declared on him when- [Erin rings bell] Einsteins?  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> What?  <br /><b>Erin:</b> What is it?  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> What?  <br /><b>Erin:</b> I did my part, babe. I&#8217;m just the bell girl. [Oscar rings bell]  <br /><b>Host:</b> Aesop&#8217;s?  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> Salman Rushdie.  <br /><b>Host:</b> Salman Rushdie is correct. [applause] Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what? [Erin rings bell]  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-  <br /><b>Erin:</b> Flying jib.  <br /><b>Host:</b> Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause]  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Robert:</b> Shalom. [sighs] Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. [grunt] I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.

<div class="quote">  <b>Robert:</b> They haven&#8217;t really improved on the Oreo, have they?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> No thank you.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Sit down, Dwight.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, &#8220;table for one?&#8221; How is this possible?  <br /><b>Robert:</b> You were dining alone? All those people are you?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager&#8217;s job. And Florida, you don&#8217;t want to live here. Even I don&#8217;t want to live here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America&#8217;s basement: It&#8217;s wet, it&#8217;s filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> N&#8230; it&#8217;s complicated.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> [holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather&#8217;s. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It&#8217;s a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> It&#8217;s a job interview, not a flea market.  <br /><b>Robert:</b> Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I&#8217;ll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.  <br /><b>Dwight:</b> Yes.  </div>
<div class="quote">  <b>Host:</b> Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you&#8217;re ready to play doctor.

[bell rings]  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Three hundred pounds!  <br /><b>Host:</b> Point for the Einsteins. [applause] Here&#8217;s your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets: This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.  <br /><b>Oscar:</b> [rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.  <br /><b>Oscar&#8217;s friend:</b> Yes!  <br /><b>Host:</b> I&#8217;m sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> [rings bell] Les Jolies Choses.  <br /><b>Meredith:</b> Are you sure?  <br /><b>Kevin:</b> Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.  <br /><b>Host:</b> The Einsteins win it!
